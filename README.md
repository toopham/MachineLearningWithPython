# MACHINE LEARNING
## _WITH PYTHON_


These are solutions written in Python to the exercises given in Coursera [Machine Learning] course with [Andrew Ng].



## Exercises



> These solutions are meant as learning tools.
> I used my solutions in MatLab and translated it into
> the language of Python. Solutions will become available as I am still working through the course. Once a solution is available, I will post the link to the README.md below
